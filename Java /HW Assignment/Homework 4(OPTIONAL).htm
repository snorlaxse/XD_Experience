<H2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">Java Calculator GUI</H2>
<P>Write a java program named Calculator (the main() should be in the class 
named <CODE>Calculator</CODE>. Your Calculator program must be a stand-alone GUI calculator (not an applet!). Your calculator must support addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. You can provide an integer based calculator (floating point is optional).</P>
<P>The user interface must include buttons that can be pressed using the mouse to enter numbers and operations, you do not need to support using the keyboard to enter numbers or operations.</P>
<P>Your calculator must allow the user to clear the display at any time.</P>
<P>Your calculator must allow the user to enter a number (by using the mouse to press the buttons), then an operator ('+', '-', ...) then another number 
followed by the '=' button. (The order is <EM>infix</EM>, not <EM>postfix</EM> 
(reverse polish)).</P>
<P>Included below is a screenshot of what is expected. Note that the sample 
shown below is an integer only calculator, feel free to create a floating point calculator or something that looks very different. The requirements are that your calculator must be functional and it's operation should be obvious.</P>
